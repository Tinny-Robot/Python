    Apply Coulomb's Law to calculate the force between two charged particles given their charges and the
    distance between them.

    :param charge1: The charge of the first particle in Coulombs.
    :param charge2: The charge of the second particle in Coulombs.
    :param distance: The distance between the particles in meters.
    :param k: The Coulomb constant. By default, it is set to 8.99e9 N*m^2/C^2.
    :return: The force between the particles in Newtons.
